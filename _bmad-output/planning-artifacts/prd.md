# Product Requirements Document - ledgy

**Author:** James
**Date:** 2026-02-20

## Executive Summary

Ledgy is a local-first personal data platform designed to break the cycle of "Tracking Abandonment" caused by rigid, specialized applications. By transitioning from a feature-centric model to a "Toolkit-First" architecture, Ledgy provides the foundational building blocks—relational ledgers and visual scripting—necessary for users to construct bespoke tracking ecosystems. Functionality is extended through a first-party plugin system; the AI Capture plugin (bundled by default) reduces data entry friction via image analysis, while remaining fully removable and replaceable. This approach leverages the "ownership effect," transforming status-tracking from a repetitive chore into a creative, evolving hobby.

### Strategic Differentiators
- **Cross-Domain Correlation:** Native ability to link disparate data points (e.g., matching heart rate to caffeine intake) without data silos.
- **Architectural Freedom:** Decoupled relational data engine allows users to define custom schemas without mid-stream logic breakage.
- **Data Sovereignty:** Private, user-controlled sync layer ensures 100% data lifetime insurance and privacy.
- **Plugin-First Extensibility:** A first-class plugin system ships with a default AI Capture plugin (Google AI Studio image-to-ledger extraction), with the core engine remaining lean and AI-free by design.

## Project Classification

- **Project Type:** Universal Web Application (Optional: Tauri 2.0 shell).
- **Domain:** Personal Productivity / Universal Life-Tracking.
- **Complexity:** Medium-High (Local-first sync, relational data integrity, visual scripting).
- **Project Context:** Brownfield (Built on established architectural research and vision docs).

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
- **Sync Performance:** Cross-device data propagation occurs in < 2 seconds on stable connections.
- **AI Capture Plugin Accuracy:** > 90% success rate in extraction of structured entries from mobile camera photos via the default-bundled AI Capture plugin (Google AI Studio).
- **System Mastery:** A non-technical user successfully builds a custom relation between two ledgers using visual nodes within their first session.
- **Retention:** User maintains daily engagement 6+ months post-setup, proving the ownership effect overcomes abandonment.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Sync and hosting infrastructure remains within 100% free tiers of GCE/Firebase.

### Technical Benchmarks
- **Zero Data Loss:** 100% reliability in PouchDB ↔ CouchDB replication across three unique device profiles.
- **Node Performance:** Visual editor maintains 60fps with 100+ active nodes.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Core functions operational in modern web browsers (Chrome/Firefox/Safari) without native OS fallbacks.

## Product Scope

### MVP - Minimum Viable Product (Phase 1)
- **Core Engine:** Project lifecycle management with multi-profile isolation.
- **Relational Ledger:** Flexible schema definition with user-defined fields and bidirectional references.
- **Visual Scripting (Beta):** Node-based editor for arithmetic, logic, and ledger automation.
- **Plugin Runtime:** First-party plugin system with a default-bundled AI Capture plugin (image-to-ledger extraction via Google AI Studio).
- **Offline-First Sync:** PouchDB ↔ CouchDB replication with manual conflict diff UI.
- **Security:** TOTP-based security via Google Authenticator.

### Growth & Vision (Phase 2+)
- **Marketplace:** Public discovery and sharing of community-contributed templates.
- **Advanced Visualizations:** Specialized data science and charting widgets.
- **Advanced AI Agents:** Multi-step reasoning and autonomous background triggers.
- **Private AI:** Migration to **Gemini Nano** for zero-latency, 100% local image analysis.

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Alex (The "Self-Tailored" Tracker)
- **Problem:** Alex cannot find an app that correlates caffeine intake with sleep quality.
- **Action:** Alex selects the "Wellness" template, adds a custom "Stress" field, and uses **AI Capture** to log their coffee. They use the **Node Editor** to link "Caffeine Ledger" to "Sleep Ledger."
- **Outcome:** A correlation graph reveals that > 200mg caffeine = 20% less deep sleep. Alex feels "Ownership" and continues tracking.

### Journey 2: Jordan (The Marketplace Creator)
- **Problem:** Jordan has a complex "Vehicle Longevity Tracker" in a spreadsheet but lacks mobile sync.
- **Action:** Jordan builds a specialized project in Ledgy with "Parts Inventory" and "Maintenance Logs." They create a "Maintenance Reminder" node based on mileage.
- **Outcome:** Jordan shares the project JSON on Discord. Dozens of users adopt the "Ultra Car-Care Template."

### Journey 3: James (Admin/Ops)
- **Problem:** James needs to ensure data integrity during a device switch.
- **Action:** James receives a "Conflict Pending" warning. He uses the **Manual Conflict Diff UI** to compare mobile vs. desktop entries, identifies a mobile typo, and accepts the desktop version.
- **Outcome:** Data is synced to his private GCE CouchDB instance with 100% accuracy.

## Domain-Specific Requirements (Local-First & Data Sovereignty)

### Compliance & Regulatory
- **Right to be Forgotten:** A "Delete Profile" action must permanently purge local (PouchDB) and remote (CouchDB) replicas.
- **Data Portability:** System must support standardized JSON export/import for all projects to prevent platform lock-in.

### Technical Constraints
- **Zero-Knowledge Encryption:** Remote data must be encrypted client-side with user-controlled keys using standard WebCrypto APIs.
- **Ghost References:** System must handle "Dangling References" (where a linked entry is deleted on another device) via a soft-delete pattern to maintain relational integrity.
- **Schema Versioning:** Every entry must include a `schema_version` metadata field to support JIT migrations and backward compatibility.

## Deployment Specific Requirements

### Platform & Update Strategy
- **Targets:** primary deployment via Web Browser, followed by native binaries via Tauri wrapper.
- **Auto-Update:** standard web-deployment caching or PWA strategies for browser; Tauri updater for binaries.
- **Privacy Footprint:** Zero telemetry or mandatory background pushes.

### Offline-First Architecture
- **Core Autonomy:** 100% operational without an internet connection. UI and local journals are served locally (e.g. via Service Workers).
- **Sync Trigger:** Remote replication activates only upon network detection and explicit user configuration of a private endpoint.

## Innovation & Novel Patterns

### The Ownership Moat
- **Toolkit-First Philosophy:** Shifting user retention from passive consumption to active building.
- **Visual Synthesis:** Native node-graph correlation of disparate life domains (e.g., fuel efficiency vs. grocery expenses).
- **Hybrid Plugin AI:** The default-bundled AI Capture plugin pairs 100% private local storage with JIT Cloud AI extraction via Google AI Studio, balancing privacy and friction—without coupling AI to the core engine.
- **Conflict Transparency:** Turning technical sync challenges into a human-governed "Data Insurance" feature.

## Functional Requirements (Capability Contract)
