- **1.5 PouchDB Core Initialization:** Wrap the browser IndexedDB layers into the primary `db.ts` abstraction.
- **1.6 TOTP Registration UI:** Build the QR code generation and Google Authenticator scanning hook.
- **1.7 WebCrypto AES-256 Engine:** Implement the HKDF key derivation from the TOTP secret and expose in-memory encrypt/decrypt primitives.
- **1.8 Auth Guard & Session Routing:** Wrap all routes to bounce unauthenticated users back to the `/unlock` screen.

## Epic 2: Profiles & Project Management
Isolated sub-databases for distinct domains of a user's life.

- **2.1 Profile DB Segregation Logic:** Ensure `create_profile` generates a distinctly named PouchDB instance isolated from others.
- **2.2 Profile Selector Canvas:** The main hub screen showing cards for all existing profiles.

- **2.5 Profile Deletion & Safety Lock:** Destructive action dialog requiring user to type the profile name to confirm hard purge.
- **2.6 Cross-Profile Storage Memory Sweeps:** Ensure that loading a new profile forcefully drops the previous profile's data from React memory to prevent leaks.
- **2.7 Template Engine (JSON Export):** Serializing a profile's schema metadata into a portable JSON structure.
- **2.8 Template Engine (JSON Import):** Scaffold a fresh profile by parsing an external `.ledgy.json` template.

## Epic 3: Relational Ledger Engine (Core Data)
The absolute core of the data layer. 15 atomic stories capturing the validation, tables, relations, and offline-durability.

- **3.1 PouchDB Document Adapters:** Strict generic wrappers forcing the `{type}:{uuid}` ID scheme and date stamping.

- **3.4 Schema Builder - Text & Number UI:** The inspector forms to define limits, max lengths, and RegEx rules for basic types.
- **3.5 Schema Builder - Date & Relation UI:** The inspector forms for relational targeting (preventing self-target loops).
- **3.6 Schema Migration JIT Engine:** Function to automatically bump older entries to the newest version schema upon read.
- **3.7 Data Lab - Tanstack Virtualized Core:** The main grid utilizing `@tanstack/react-virtual` to handle 10,000+ rows smoothly.
- **3.8 Data Lab - Header & Custom Sorting:** Drag-to-resize columns and multi-column sorting state.

- **3.10 Data Lab - Relation Combobox Querying:** The optimized fuzzy-search dropdown to link distant ledger entries without lag.
- **3.11 Data Lab - Focus Management:** `Tab`, `Shift+Tab`, `Enter`, and `Escape` handlers locking focus entirely within the grid cells.
- **3.12 Data Lab - Bulk Selection & Edit States:** Checkbox column to allow mass-deletion or tag assignment.
- **3.13 Bidirectional Link Writing:** The sync logic ensuring if A links to B, B's document is updated with A's backlink.
- **3.14 Ghost Reference Fallback Rendering:** The UI safety mechanism preventing crashes when a cell points to a deleted UUID.
- **3.15 Local Undo/Redo Stack:** Intercepting PouchDB actions within a 15-minute window to allow `Ctrl+Z` rollbacks.

## Epic 4: Node Forge (Visual Scripting Engine)
The drag-and-drop workspace where schemas talk to each other.

- **4.1 React Flow Canvas Core & Viewport:** The main infinite `<ReactFlow>` wrapper spanning the screen layout.
- **4.2 Node Store & Debounced Persistence:** The global state tracking X/Y coordinates, serializing to PouchDB 1 second after drag stop.
- **4.3 Minimap & Zoom-to-Fit Controls:** The HUD elements allowing fast navigation of massive 100+ node graphs.
- **4.4 Ledger Source Node Component:** Visual block exposing a ledger's schema fields as hookable outputs.
- **4.5 Correlation Node (Math) Component:** Visual block defining basic arithmetic or Pearson's coefficient targets.
- **4.6 Complex Edge Connection Snapping:** The magnetic wire logic connecting node handles.
- **4.7 Strict Edge Type Validation:** Logic to explicitly reject wiring a Text output into a Date input, dropping the dragged wire gracefully.
- **4.8 Sub-Graph Container Grouping:** Ability to lasso 5 nodes and bundle them into a single parent folder node for workspace tidiness.
- **4.9 Graph PouchDB Hydration Hooks:** The real-time queries pushing live ledger numbers into the visual Graph memory.
- **4.10 Web Worker Computation Offloading:** Thread isolation so complex Pearson correlation math on 10k rows doesn't freeze the canvas pan/zoom thread.
- **4.11 Cyclic Dependency Prevention Engine:** The traversal algorithm executing on wire-drop that throws an error if A triggers B triggers A.
- **4.12 Autonomous Trigger Nodes (On-Create):** Nodes listening to the global event bus for specific Ledger mutations to fire.
- **4.13 Autonomous Trigger Action Nodes:** The final tail nodes that successfully write *new* data back into PouchDB autonomously.
- **4.14 Trigger Execution Depth Limiter:** The safety circuit breaker stopping rogue scripts after 100 recursive hops.
- **4.15 Node Engine Keyboard Shortcuts & Group Ops:** `Shift+Click` multi-select, copy (`Cmd+C`), paste (`Cmd+V`) graph segments, and `Delete`.

## Epic 5: Dashboard & Live Widgets
Where the computed Node outputs become glanceable health indicators.

- **6.5 Diff Guard Layout Modal:** The intense side-by-side GUI showing "Desktop Version" against "Mobile Version".
- **6.6 Diff Guard Field-Level Merging:** Allowing the user to accept the "Sleep" number from Mobile, but the "Notes" text from Desktop.
- **6.7 Exponential Backoff Network Retry:** The silent failover logic ensuring failed remote servers don't drain laptop battery spam-pinging.
- **6.8 Total Remote Annihilation (Right to be Forgotten):** A specific payload executing an administrative DB-Wipe remote command.
- **6.9 E2E Payload Envelope Wrapping:** The interceptor grabbing PouchDB docs *just before* transmission and applying AES-GCM wrapping.
- **6.10 Manual HTML/CSV Export Adapters:** Plaintext data dumps for users paranoid about app lock-in.
