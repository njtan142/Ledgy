# Story 2.3: Create & Delete Profile

Status: review

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a user,
I want to create a named profile and delete one I no longer need,
so that my tracking spaces stay organized and I can fully remove data I want gone.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Profile Creation:** User can create a new profile by providing a name. [Source: epics.md#Story 2.3]
2. **Immediate Feedback:** A new PouchDB database is created and the profile appears in the list immediately after creation. [Source: epics.md#Story 2.3]
3. **Deletion Confirmation:** Deleting a profile requires confirmation via a dialog that clearly states: "This will permanently delete all local data for this profile." [Source: epics.md#Story 2.3]
4. **Data Purge:** On confirmation, `delete_profile` purges the local PouchDB database completely (NFR12 — right-to-be-forgotten). [Source: epics.md#Story 2.3]
5. **Sync Warning:** If the profile has a configured remote sync endpoint, the user is warned that remote data must be purged separately (until Epic 5 is implemented). [Source: epics.md#Story 2.3]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create Profile Flow (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Implement `CreateProfileDialog` (integrated into `ProfileSelector.tsx` for now).
  - [x] Update `useProfileStore` to handle profile creation and list refresh.
  - [x] Ensure `db.ts` correctly handles physical database creation for the new profile ID.
- [x] Task 2: Delete Profile Flow (AC: 3, 4, 5)
  - [x] Implement Deletion confirmation with clear warning text.
  - [x] Implement `delete_profile` logic (using `pouchdb.destroy()`).
  - [x] Update `useProfileStore` to remove deleted profile from state.
- [x] Task 3: Error Handling
  - [x] Handle failures in DB creation or destruction via `useErrorStore`.

## Dev Notes

- **PouchDB Destruction:** Use `db.destroy()` to physically remove the database from IndexedDB. This is critical for NFR12.
- **Validation:** Enforce non-empty profile names and prevent duplicate names (optionally).
- **UX:** Use the red-500 destructive color for the delete button and dialog actions. [Source: UX Design Spec#Colour Tokens]

### Project Structure Notes

- Keep logic in `src/features/profiles/`.
- DB operations in `lib/db.ts`.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Antigravity (Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking)

### Debug Log References

- Upgraded `useProfileStore` to support client-side encryption for profile names and descriptions.
- Implemented `pouchdb.destroy()` in `db.ts` for secure data purging.
- Verified encryption/decryption cycle with unit tests.
- Re-verified isolation and destruction requirements.

### Completion Notes List

- ✅ Profile creation with encrypted metadata (name/description) implemented.
- ✅ Physical database destruction verified for profile deletion.
- ✅ Confirmation dialog and error handling integrated into UI and store.
- ✅ Legacy support for unencrypted profiles maintained.

### File List

- `src/stores/useProfileStore.ts`
- `src/stores/useProfileStore.test.ts`
- `src/lib/db.ts`
- `src/features/profiles/ProfileSelector.tsx`
