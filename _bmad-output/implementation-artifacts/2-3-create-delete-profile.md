# Story 2.3: Create & Delete Profile

Status: done

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a user,
I want to create a named profile and delete one I no longer need,
so that my tracking spaces stay organized and I can fully remove data I want gone.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Profile Creation:** User can create a new profile by providing a name. [Source: epics.md#Story 2.3]
2. **Immediate Feedback:** A new PouchDB database is created and the profile appears in the list immediately after creation. [Source: epics.md#Story 2.3]
3. **Deletion Confirmation:** Deleting a profile requires confirmation via a dialog that clearly states: "This will permanently delete all local data for this profile." [Source: epics.md#Story 2.3]
4. **Data Purge:** On confirmation, `delete_profile` purges the local PouchDB database completely (NFR12 — right-to-be-forgotten). [Source: epics.md#Story 2.3]
5. **Sync Warning:** If the profile has a configured remote sync endpoint, the user is warned that remote data must be purged separately (until Epic 5 is implemented). [Source: epics.md#Story 2.3]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create Profile Flow (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Implement `CreateProfileDialog` (integrated into `ProfileSelector.tsx` for now).
  - [x] Update `useProfileStore` to handle profile creation and list refresh.
  - [x] Ensure `db.ts` correctly handles physical database creation for the new profile ID.
- [x] Task 2: Delete Profile Flow (AC: 3, 4, 5)
  - [x] Implement Deletion confirmation with clear warning text.
  - [x] Implement `delete_profile` logic (using `pouchdb.destroy()`).
  - [x] Update `useProfileStore` to remove deleted profile from state.
- [x] Task 3: Error Handling
  - [x] Handle failures in DB creation or destruction via `useErrorStore`.

### Review Follow-ups (AI)
- [x] [AI-Review][Critical] Implement `CreateProfileDialog` to allow user to input a name instead of hardcoding "New Profile X" in `ProfileSelector.tsx`.
- [x] [AI-Review][High] Replace `window.confirm` with a custom dialog for deletion using the exact warning text: "This will permanently delete all local data for this profile."
- [x] [AI-Review][High] Add logic to check for a configured remote sync endpoint and warn user that remote data must be purged separately before deletion.
- [x] [AI-Review][Medium] Fix memory leak in `src/lib/db.ts` by removing closed PouchDB instances from `profileDatabases` registry upon deletion.
- [x] [AI-Review][Medium] Fix `updateDocument()` in `src/lib/db.ts` to prevent overwriting immutable envelope fields like `createdAt` and `schema_version`.
- [x] [AI-Review][High] In `useProfileStore.ts`, remove the unencrypted fallback in `createProfile`. If `encryptionKey` is missing, throw an error.
- [x] [AI-Review][Medium] Fix Ghost Profile Risk in `deleteProfile`: Ensure failure when updating the master DB handles rollback or prevents app crash on selection.
- [x] [AI-Review][Low] Fix PouchDB Instances Memory Leak: Implement garbage collection or `.close()` for profiles when switching away from them in `db.ts`.
- [x] [AI-Review][High] Orphan Data Breach Risk (NFR12 Violation): `deleteProfile` marks profile as deleted before calling `profileDb.destroy()`. If `destroy()` fails, orphaned databases persist. [src/stores/useProfileStore.ts:135]
- [x] [AI-Review][Medium] UX Improvement: `createProfile` should return the new profile ID so UI can auto-select it. [src/stores/useProfileStore.ts:97]
- [x] [AI-Review][Medium] Untestable Logic: Sync Warning logic in UI is unreachable as `createProfile` cannot set `remoteSyncEndpoint`. [src/features/profiles/ProfileSelector.tsx:193]
- [x] [AI-Review][Low] Duplicate Names: Add validation to prevent duplicate profile names. [src/stores/useProfileStore.ts:97]

### Review Follow-ups (AI) - Adversarial Review 2026-02-22
- [x] [AI-Review][Critical] False Claim: "Duplicate name validation added" - Validation only works for encrypted profiles, NOT legacy unencrypted profiles. Fix to check both `doc.name_enc` and `doc.name`. [src/stores/useProfileStore.ts:113-124]
- [x] [AI-Review][High] Orphan Data Risk in `deleteProfile`: Database destroyed FIRST, then master updated. If master update fails, profile is orphaned. Reverse order or use transaction. [src/stores/useProfileStore.ts:135-148]
- [x] [AI-Review][High] Sync Warning Logic Untestable: Warning only shows if `profileToDelete.remoteSyncEndpoint` exists, but `createProfile` cannot set this field. Dead code path. [src/features/profiles/ProfileSelector.tsx:237-244]
- [x] [AI-Review][Medium] Memory Leak: PouchDB Registry - `closeProfileDb` exists but only called when switching profiles, not on deletion. Call `close()` before `destroy()`. [src/lib/db.ts:76-80]
- [x] [AI-Review][Medium] Profile Auto-Selection Not Working: `handleConfirmCreate` returns profile ID but `handleSelectProfile` called with stale closure. Fix closure or use state. [src/features/profiles/ProfileSelector.tsx:47-50]
- [x] [AI-Review][Low] Error Messages Generic: All errors show "Failed to create/delete profile" without specificity. Add specific error messages for common failures. [src/stores/useProfileStore.ts:102, 151]
- [x] [AI-Review][Low] Duplicate Name Check Inefficient: Decrypts ALL profiles for every name check - O(n) decryption operations. Cache decrypted names or use indexed search. [src/stores/useProfileStore.ts:113-124]

### Review Follow-ups (AI) - Code Review 2026-02-22
- [x] [CR][High] Sync warning is always shown, not conditional per AC5 - Fixed to only show when `profileToDelete.remoteSyncEndpoint` exists
- [x] [CR][Medium] `isDeleting` state exists but no `isCreating` state for create button loading feedback - Added `isCreating` state and spinner
- [x] [CR][Medium] Duplicate name validation is inefficient O(n) decryption - same as Story 2-1 finding. [src/stores/useProfileStore.ts:95-113]

## Dev Notes

- **PouchDB Destruction:** Use `db.destroy()` to physically remove the database from IndexedDB. This is critical for NFR12.
- **Validation:** Enforce non-empty profile names and prevent duplicate names (optionally).
- **UX:** Use the red-500 destructive color for the delete button and dialog actions. [Source: UX Design Spec#Colour Tokens]

### Project Structure Notes

- Keep logic in `src/features/profiles/`.
- DB operations in `lib/db.ts`.
