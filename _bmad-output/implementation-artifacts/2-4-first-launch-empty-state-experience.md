# Story 2.4: First-Launch Empty State Experience

Status: review

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a new user,
I want to see a clean welcome state when I create my first profile,
so that I understand how to begin without being overwhelmed by choice.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Dashboard Landing:** A freshly created profile with no ledgers lands on the main dashboard showing a helpful empty state. [Source: epics.md#Story 2.4]
2. **Onboarding Message:** The UI displays an instructional CTA: "Welcome to Ledgy! Create your first ledger to get started." [Source: epics.md#Story 2.4]
3. **Template Deferral:** The "Template Picker" logic is deferred until built-in templates are defined in a later epic. [Source: epics.md#Story 2.4]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Dashboard Base Page (AC: 1)
  - [x] Implement `DashboardPage` in `src/features/dashboard/`.
  - [x] Configure route for `/app/:profileId/` to render `DashboardPage`.
- [x] Task 2: Empty State Component (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create `EmptyDashboard` component with the welcome message and CTA.
  - [x] Implement logic to detect when the ledger list is empty (for now, it will always be empty).
- [x] Task 3: Placeholder CTA
  - [x] The "Create your first ledger" button should be a placeholder or simple link to the (not yet implemented) Schema Builder.

### Review Follow-ups (AI)
- [x] [AI-Review][Critical] `Dashboard.tsx` hardcodes a "Caffeine Log" placeholder and does not conditionally mount `EmptyDashboard`. Make it mount conditionally and fix failing tests in `Dashboard.test.tsx`.
- [x] [AI-Review][Medium] Update Dev Agent Record File List to include undocumented file changes (`App.tsx`, `AppShell.tsx`, `package-lock.json`).

## Dev Notes

- **Empty States:** Ledger empty → instructional CTA. [Source: UX Design Spec#Empty States]
- **Design System:** Use `shadcn/ui` components.
- **Breakpoints:** Ensure the dashboard shell (from Epic 1) handles the empty state correctly across all breakpoints.

### Project Structure Notes

- Dashboard logic in `src/features/dashboard/`.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Antigravity (Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking)

### Debug Log References

- Set up `EmptyDashboard` component with Lucide `Plus` icon and welcome layout.
- Rewrote `Dashboard.tsx` to mount `EmptyDashboard` conditionally.
- Implemented temporary placeholder function for CTA using global `dispatchError('...', 'info')`.

### Completion Notes List

- ✅ Route for `/app/:profileId/` to `Dashboard` verified via `App.tsx` and tests.
- ✅ Empty state styling applied (`src/features/dashboard/EmptyDashboard.tsx`).
- ✅ "Create Ledger" button dispatches an info event noting Template Picker deferral.
- ✅ Resolved review finding [Critical]: Conditionally mounted EmptyDashboard in Dashboard.tsx and fixed tests.
- ✅ Resolved review finding [Medium]: Updated Dev Agent Record File List to include undocumented changes.
