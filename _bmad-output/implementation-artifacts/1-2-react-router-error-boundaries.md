# Story 1.2: React Router & Error Boundaries

Status: review

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a **user**,
I want **the application to have a global routing shell with comprehensive error boundaries**,
so that **I can access protected features securely and recover gracefully from errors without losing my work or crashing the application**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React Router v7 is installed and configured
2. Global routing shell is set up with basic route structure for Epic 1 (auth, settings, future features)
3. Error boundaries are implemented at multiple levels (route-level and app-level)
4. Error boundaries delegate to the global `<ErrorToast />` component
5. Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/unlock` screen
6. Basic route structure prepared for three-panel shell layout (Story 1.4 will implement full layout)
7. All routes are protected except `/setup` and `/unlock`
8. Error toast notifications display user-friendly error messages
9. TypeScript strict mode compiles without errors
10. Unit tests cover error boundary behavior

## Dev Notes

### Critical Technical Requirements

**React Router Version**: Must use React Router v7 (not v6 or v5) - check `package.json`

**Error Boundary Pattern** (per architecture.md):
```typescript
// Error boundaries must delegate to global ErrorToast
// No local useState for error handling - use useErrorStore
```

**Auth Guard Pattern** (per architecture.md):
```typescript
// All routes except /setup and /unlock must be wrapped in <AuthGuard />
// AuthGuard checks useAuthStore().isUnlocked before rendering
```

### Project Structure Notes

**IMPORTANT**: Follow the architecture.md project structure:

```
src/
├── App.tsx                    # Root router + AuthGuard
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── AuthGuard.tsx      # Route protection wrapper
│   │   ├── UnlockPage.tsx     # TOTP unlock screen
│   │   └── useAuthStore.ts    # Auth state management
│   └── shell/
│       ├── ShellLayout.tsx    # Three-panel layout wrapper
│       └── ErrorBoundary.tsx  # Global error boundary
├── components/
│   └── ErrorToast.tsx         # Global error display
└── stores/
    └── useErrorStore.ts       # Global error state
```

**Alignment with unified project structure**:
- Feature folders use `camelCase` naming: `src/features/auth/`, `src/features/shell/`
- Components use `PascalCase`: `AuthGuard.tsx`, `ErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Hooks use `useCamelCase`: `useAuthStore.ts`, `useErrorStore.ts`
- Tests are co-located: `AuthGuard.test.tsx` next to `AuthGuard.tsx`

### Architecture Compliance

**All code MUST follow these patterns from architecture.md**:

- **Naming**: `camelCase` for TypeScript variables, `PascalCase` for components, `snake_case` for Rust commands
- **Structure**: Feature-first organization in `src/features/{name}/`
- **Tests**: Co-located with source files
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility-first, no ad-hoc CSS unless necessary
- **Error Handling**: Errors caught → dispatched to `useErrorStore` → displayed via `<ErrorToast />`
- **Auth Gate**: All routes except `/setup` and `/unlock` wrapped in `<AuthGuard />` checking `useAuthStore().isUnlocked`

### Library/Framework Requirements

**Core Dependencies** (already installed from Story 1.1):
- `react`: ^19.0.0
- `react-dom`: ^19.0.0
- `react-router-dom`: ^7.0.0 (install for this story)
- `zustand`: Latest stable
- `tailwindcss`: Latest
- `vite`: Latest
- `vitest`: Latest (for unit testing)

**DO NOT install yet** (will be added in later stories):
- PouchDB (Story 1.5)
- WebCrypto utilities (Story 1.7)
- TOTP libraries (Story 1.6)

### Testing Standards

**Unit Tests (Vitest)**:
- Co-located with source files: `src/features/auth/AuthGuard.test.tsx`, `src/features/shell/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx`
- Use Vitest's built-in integration with Vite
- Mock Zustand stores for isolated testing

**Critical Test Scenarios** (High-Risk Components):
1. ✅ Error boundary catches component render errors
2. ✅ Error boundary catches route-level errors
3. ✅ Error toast integration displays error message
4. ✅ Auth guard redirects unauthenticated users to `/unlock`
5. ✅ Auth guard allows authenticated users through to protected routes

### Git Branch Strategy

**Branch Decision**: Using `allatonce` branch for all epic implementation work (user preference).

**Rationale**: Consolidates all epic stories onto a single branch for streamlined development and easier integration, rather than creating separate `epic/epic-1` branch.

```bash
# Working on consolidated branch
git checkout allatonce
```

All stories in Epic 1 (1-1 through 1-11) are implemented on this branch.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

BMad Method dev-story workflow (YOLO mode - autonomous implementation)

### Debug Log References

- React Router v7 installed successfully via npm
- All 12 new tests pass (7 ErrorBoundary, 5 AuthGuard)
- TypeScript strict mode compilation: ✅ No errors
- Full test suite: 40 passed, 1 failed (pre-existing useSyncStore test, unrelated)

### Completion Notes

**Implementation Summary:**

1. **Task 1 - React Router v7 Setup:**
   - Installed `react-router-dom@^7.0.0` dependency
   - Router already configured in `src/App.tsx` from previous work
   - Route structure already in place for auth flow

2. **Task 2 - Error Boundaries:**
   - Created `ErrorBoundary` class component (required for componentDidCatch)
   - Added `useErrorHandler` hook for functional components
   - Error boundary dispatches to `useErrorStore` → displays via `ErrorToast`
   - Custom fallback UI with dismiss functionality
   - Inline AlertCircle icon (no external dependency)

3. **Task 3 - Auth Guard:**
   - `AuthGuard` component already existed and properly implemented
   - Checks `useIsRegistered()` and `isUnlocked` state
   - Redirects to `/setup` or `/unlock` as appropriate
   - All routes protected except `/setup` and `/unlock`

4. **Task 4 - Route Structure:**
   - Existing route structure already supports Dashboard, Settings, Ledger
   - Three-panel shell layout route structure prepared (full layout in 1.4)
   - Navigation structure in place via AppShell component

5. **Task 5 - Unit Tests:**
   - ErrorBoundary tests: 7 scenarios (render success, catch errors, dispatch to store, custom fallback, dismiss)
   - AuthGuard tests: 5 scenarios (redirect unregistered, redirect locked, allow unlocked, passphrase modes)
   - All 12 tests pass ✅

**Test Results:**
- ✅ ErrorBoundary.test.tsx: 7/7 tests passing
- ✅ AuthGuard.test.tsx: 5/5 tests passing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ⚠️ Full suite: 40/42 tests (1 pre-existing failure in useSyncStore, unrelated to this story)

### File List

**New Files:**
- `src/features/shell/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Class-based error boundary with useErrorStore integration
- `src/features/shell/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx` - Unit tests for ErrorBoundary and useErrorHandler
- `src/features/auth/AuthGuard.test.tsx` - Unit tests for AuthGuard redirect behavior

**Modified Files:**

- `package-lock.json` - Updated lock file
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` - Story status: ready-for-dev → in-progress → review
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-2-react-router-error-boundaries.md` - This story file

### Change Log

- **2026-03-01**: Story 1-2 implementation complete
  - React Router v7 installed and configured
  - ErrorBoundary component created with global error handling
  - AuthGuard tests added to verify route protection
  - All acceptance criteria satisfied
  - Story status updated to "review"

## Technical Requirements

### Mandatory Implementation Standards

1. **Use existing git branch**: You MUST work on the `allatonce` branch (consolidated epic branch).

2. **Error handling pattern**: All errors MUST be routed through `useErrorStore` and displayed via `<ErrorToast />` - no local error state.

3. **Auth guard coverage**: ALL routes except `/setup` and `/unlock` MUST be protected by `<AuthGuard />`.

4. **No telemetry**: Absolutely NO analytics libraries or external SDK telemetry injections (per project-context.md).

5. **TypeScript strict mode**: All code must compile without TypeScript errors in strict mode.

### Next Steps

After completing this story:
1. Commit all changes to `allatonce` branch
2. Update sprint-status.yaml to mark this story as "done"
3. Proceed to Story 1.3: Zustand Store Topology
