# Story 1.4: Three-Panel Shell Layout

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is recommended. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a **user**,
I want **a responsive three-panel shell layout with sidebar, main canvas, and inspector rail**,
so that **I can efficiently navigate the application, work in the main content area, and access contextual tools**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Three-panel layout implemented: sidebar (navigation), main canvas (content), inspector rail (tools)
2. Sidebar contains navigation menu with profile switcher, projects, ledger, node forge, dashboard, settings
3. Main canvas renders route-based content (projects, ledger views, node editor, dashboard)
4. Inspector rail provides contextual tools based on active view
5. All panels are collapsible with smooth animations
6. Layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes
7. Panel widths/sizes are persisted in useUIStore
8. Layout integrates with existing ErrorBoundary and AuthGuard
9. Tailwind CSS utility classes used for all styling
10. TypeScript strict mode compiles without errors
11. Unit tests cover layout behavior and panel state
12. Keyboard shortcuts for panel toggling (Cmd+B sidebar, Cmd+I inspector)

## Dev Notes

### Critical Technical Requirements

**Layout Pattern** (per architecture.md):
```typescript
// Three-panel layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox
// Sidebar: 240-320px (collapsible)
// Main Canvas: flex-grow (100% remaining space)
// Inspector Rail: 280-360px (collapsible)
```

**Responsive Breakpoints**:
```
Mobile (<768px):   [Canvas only] - panels hidden by default
Tablet (768-1024): [Sidebar][Canvas] - inspector hidden
Desktop (>1024px): [Sidebar][Canvas][Inspector] - all visible
```

**State Management** (per Story 1-3):
```typescript
// All layout state in useUIStore - NO local useState
// Persist panel widths and open/closed state
// Error handling via useErrorStore dispatch
```

### Project Structure Notes

**Component Organization**:
```
src/
├── features/
│   └── shell/
│       ├── AppShell.tsx         # Main three-panel layout
│       ├── Sidebar.tsx          # Navigation sidebar
│       ├── MainCanvas.tsx       # Main content area
│       ├── InspectorRail.tsx    # Contextual tools
│       └── useShellLayout.ts    # Layout state hooks (optional)
└── stores/
    └── useUIStore.ts            # Extended with layout state
```

**Alignment with architecture.md**:
- Feature folders use `camelCase`: `src/features/shell/`
- Components use `PascalCase`: `AppShell.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`
- Hooks use `useCamelCase`: `useShellLayout` (if needed)
- Tests co-located: `AppShell.test.tsx` next to `AppShell.tsx`

### Architecture Compliance

**All code MUST follow these patterns from architecture.md**:

- **Naming**: `camelCase` for variables, `PascalCase` for components
- **Structure**: Feature-first organization
- **Tests**: Co-located with source files
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility-first, NO ad-hoc CSS
- **State**: Zustand stores only - no local useState for layout state
- **Error Handling**: Errors dispatched to useErrorStore

**Integration with Previous Stories**:
- Story 1-2: ErrorBoundary wraps AppShell, AuthGuard protects routes
- Story 1-3: useUIStore follows store topology pattern

### Library/Framework Requirements

**Core Dependencies** (already installed):
- `react`: ^19.0.0
- `react-router-dom`: ^7.0.0 (for Outlet component)
- `zustand`: Latest stable (useUIStore)
- `tailwindcss`: Latest (all styling)

**DO NOT install**:
- Additional layout libraries (use Tailwind/CSS Grid)
- Animation libraries (use Tailwind transitions)

### Testing Standards

**Unit Tests (Vitest)**:
- Co-located: `src/features/shell/AppShell.test.tsx`
- Test component rendering
- Test panel toggle behavior
- Test responsive breakpoints (mock window width)
- Test keyboard shortcuts
- Test persistence (mock localStorage)

**Critical Test Scenarios**:
1. ✅ AppShell renders with correct three-panel structure
2. ✅ Sidebar toggles open/closed
3. ✅ Inspector toggles open/closed
4. ✅ Layout responds to screen size changes
5. ✅ Keyboard shortcuts trigger panel toggles
6. ✅ Layout preferences persist across reloads

### Git Branch Strategy

**Branch Decision**: Using `allatonce` branch for all epic implementation work.

```bash
git checkout allatonce
```

### Previous Story Intelligence

**From Story 1-2 (React Router & Error Boundaries)**:
- ErrorBoundary component available for wrapping AppShell
- AuthGuard protects all routes except /setup and /unlock
- ErrorToast integration working

**From Story 1-3 (Zustand Store Topology)**:
- useUIStore pattern established
- All state in stores - no local useState
- Error dispatch pattern: useErrorStore.getState().dispatchError()

**Code Patterns to Reuse**:
- Component structure from Story 1-2
- Store pattern from Story 1-3
- Test structure from both stories

## Technical Requirements

### Mandatory Implementation Standards

1. **Use existing git branch**: You MUST work on the `allatonce` branch.

2. **No local useState for layout state**: All panel open/closed state MUST be in useUIStore.

3. **Tailwind CSS only**: NO ad-hoc CSS files - use utility classes exclusively.

4. **Responsive design**: Layout MUST work on mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.

5. **Keyboard shortcuts**: Cmd+B (sidebar), Cmd+I (inspector) MUST be implemented.

6. **Persistence**: Panel widths and open/closed state MUST persist in localStorage.

7. **TypeScript strict mode**: All code must compile without errors.

8. **Test co-location**: All tests MUST be co-located with source files.

### Next Steps

After completing this story:
1. Commit all changes to `allatonce` branch
2. Update sprint-status.yaml to mark this story as "done"
3. Proceed to Story 1.5: PouchDB Core Initialization
