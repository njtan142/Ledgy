# Story 4.1: Node Canvas & Engine Foundation

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a builder,
I want an infinite canvas to visually script my ledger logic,
So that I can see how data flows between different domains of my life.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Canvas Rendering:** React Flow canvas renders at `/app/:profileId/node-forge` with smooth 60fps pan/zoom. [Source: epics.md#Story 4.1]
2. **Infinite Canvas:** User can pan (`Space` + drag) and zoom infinitely without boundaries. [Source: epics.md#Story 4.1]
3. **State Persistence:** Canvas state (node positions, zoom level, viewport) persists to `useNodeStore` and saves to PouchDB. [Source: epics.md#Story 4.1]
4. **Empty State:** First-time user opening empty canvas sees interactive overlay guiding them to drag their first node. [Source: epics.md#Story 4.1]
5. **Performance:** Canvas maintains 60fps with 100+ nodes (NFR2). [Source: epics.md#Story 4.1]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: React Flow Canvas Setup (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create `NodeCanvas` component in `src/features/nodeEditor/`.
  - [ ] Configure React Flow with pan/zoom enabled.
  - [ ] Implement `Space` + drag for panning (keyboard shortcut).
  - [ ] Add zoom controls (mouse wheel, pinch).
- [ ] Task 2: Node Store & Persistence (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create `useNodeStore` Zustand store with `nodes`, `edges`, `viewport` state.
  - [ ] Implement `saveCanvas` and `loadCanvas` in `src/lib/db.ts`.
  - [ ] Wire auto-save on node/edge changes (debounced).
  - [ ] Ensure canvas documents follow `{type}:{uuid}` ID scheme.
- [ ] Task 3: Empty State & Onboarding (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create `EmptyCanvasGuide` overlay component.
  - [ ] Show guide when no nodes exist.
  - [ ] Dismissible guide with "Drag your first node" instruction.
- [ ] Task 4: Performance Optimization (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement node memoization for re-renders.
  - [ ] Add viewport culling (only render visible nodes).
  - [ ] Test with 100+ dummy nodes to verify 60fps.
- [ ] Task 5: Integration & Testing
  - [ ] Add route `/app/:profileId/node-forge` in `App.tsx`.
  - [ ] Add navigation item in left sidebar (Node Forge).
  - [ ] Add unit tests for store persistence.
  - [ ] Add integration tests for canvas interactions.

## Dev Notes

- **React Flow Version:** Use `@xyflow/react` v12+ (latest stable).
- **Canvas Document Structure:**
  ```typescript
  {
    _id: `canvas:${profileId}:default`,
    _type: 'canvas',
    schema_version: 1,
    createdAt: ISO8601,
    updatedAt: ISO8601,
    nodes: Node[],
    edges: Edge[],
    viewport: { x: number, y: number, zoom: number }
  }
  ```
- **Performance:** Use `React.memo()` on node components, avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** `Space` for pan, `Delete` for node removal, `Cmd+S` for manual save.

### Project Structure Notes

- Components in `src/features/nodeEditor/`
- Store in `src/stores/useNodeStore.ts`
- DAL functions in `src/lib/db.ts`
- Types in `src/types/nodeEditor.ts`
