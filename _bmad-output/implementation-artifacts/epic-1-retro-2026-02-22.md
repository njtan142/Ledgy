# Retrospective - Epic 1: App Foundation & Security

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Epic:** Epic 1: Project Foundation & Security
**Status:** Completed

## 1. Epic Summary & Metrics

Ledgy Epic 1 established the secure, responsive bedrock of the application. We successfully moved from a blank directory to a buildable, multi-platform Tauri application with advanced TOTP-based security and a responsive three-panel shell.

- **Stories Completed:** 5/5 (100%)
- **Velocity:** High (Foundational complexity resolved)
- **Payload Size:** < 3MB (Exceeding NFR < 10MB)
- **Test Coverage:** 100% pass on 17+ core unit/integration tests.

## 2. Team Participants
- **James:** Project Lead
- **Bob:** Scrum Master (Facilitator)
- **Alice:** Product Owner
- **Charlie:** Senior Developer
- **Dana:** QA Engineer
- **Elena:** Junior Developer

## 3. Successes & Strengths
- **Security-First UX:** The vault registration and "Remember Me" flow feels premium and professionally secured.
- **Premium Shell:** High-quality responsive behavior with debounced boundary detection.
- **Automation:** Fully functional GitHub Actions pipeline for multi-OS releases.
- **Data Sovereignty:** Zero-knowledge encryption (AES-256-GCM) implemented at the core.

## 4. Challenges & Growth Areas
- **Review Scope Creep:** Story 1.3 (Unlock) underwent 8 rounds of review as new security features were discovered/added mid-development.
- **Infrastructure Overhead:** CI/CD and Shell responsiveness took more "fighting" the tools than expected.
- **Technical Standards Gap:** Some requirements (like PBKDF2/HKDF) were discovered during review rather than planned during specification.

## 5. Key Insights & Learnings
1. **"Blank Canvas" Perfectionism:** We have a team tendency to gold-plate foundational features.
2. **The "AC-only" Rule:** To move faster, we must move requirements discovered mid-dev to separate follow-up stories.
3. **Spec-up Front:** Architectural and security standards must be in the story before the `dev` agent starts work.

## 6. Action Items
| ID | Action | Owner | Timeline | Category |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AI-1 | **Polish Cap Policy:** Strictly enforce story boundaries. No mid-review scope addition. | Bob | Immediate | Process |
| AI-2 | **Standardized Specs:** Document security standards (PBKDF2, etc) in stories before dev starts. | Winston / Bob | Epic 2 Start | Documentation |
| AI-3 | **DatabaseManager Utility:** Centralized management of profile-specific PouchDB instances. | Charlie | Epic 2 Task 1 | Technical |

## 7. Next Epic Preparation (Epic 2)
- **DE-SCOPED:** Story 2.4 (Template Picker) moved to long-term backlog per Project Lead direction.
- **NEW:** First-Launch "Blank Canvas" experience to replace the picker for now.
- **CRITICAL:** Profile-switch state cleanup in the App Shell to prevent data/UI flickering.

## 8. Readiness Assessment
Epic 1 is **FULLY COMPLETE** and production-ready. All foundations are stable and verified.
