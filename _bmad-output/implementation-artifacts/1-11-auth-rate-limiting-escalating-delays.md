# Story 1.11: Auth Rate Limiting & Escalating Delays

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is recommended. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a **security-conscious user**,
I want **the application to implement rate limiting on authentication attempts**,
so that **brute-force attacks are prevented and my account remains secure**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Failed login attempts are tracked per account/IP
2. Exponential backoff implemented (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s, 60s...)
3. Maximum 5 failed attempts before lockout
4. Lockout duration: 15 minutes after max attempts
5. Rate limiting state persists across page reloads
6. User-friendly error messages showing wait time
7. TypeScript strict mode compiles without errors
8. Unit tests cover rate limiting logic and edge cases
9. Integration with useAuthStore.unlock() flow
10. Admin bypass option (for emergency access - future enhancement)

## Dev Notes

### Critical Technical Requirements

**Exponential Backoff Formula**:
```typescript
// Delay = baseDelay * 2^(attemptNumber - 1)
// Attempts: 1=1s, 2=2s, 3=4s, 4=8s, 5=16s, 6+=30s (capped)
const baseDelay = 1000; // 1 second
const delay = Math.min(baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempts - 1), 30000);
```

**Rate Limit State Structure**:
```typescript
interface RateLimitState {
    attempts: number;
    lastAttempt: number; // Unix timestamp
    lockedUntil: number | null; // Unix timestamp or null
}
```

**Lockout Flow**:
```
1. User enters TOTP code
2. Check rate limit → if locked, show wait time
3. If not locked, attempt unlock
4. If failed → increment attempts, check if lockout
5. If success → reset attempts
```

### Project Structure Notes

**Rate Limiter Organization**:
```
src/
├── lib/
│   └── rateLimiter.ts         # Rate limiting logic + persistence
├── features/
│   └── auth/
│       └── UnlockPage.tsx     # Display wait time, disable button
└── stores/
    └── useAuthStore.ts        # Integration with unlock()
```

### Architecture Compliance

**All code MUST follow these patterns from architecture.md**:

- **Naming**: `camelCase` for functions, `PascalCase` for interfaces
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly messages, no internal details
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode
- **Security**: No timing attacks, consistent response times

**Integration with Previous Stories**:
- Story 1-3: useAuthStore integration
- Story 1-6: TOTP verification is rate-limited
- Story 1-8: Auth guard protects against unauthorized access

### Library/Framework Requirements

**Core Dependencies** (already installed):
- No new dependencies needed
- Uses localStorage for persistence
- Native Date.now() for timing

### Testing Standards

**Unit Tests (Vitest)**:
- Co-located: `src/lib/rateLimiter.test.ts`
- Use fake timers for time-based tests
- Mock localStorage for persistence tests
- Test edge cases (midnight UTC, DST changes)

**Critical Test Scenarios**:
1. ✅ First attempt has no delay
2. ✅ Each failed attempt increases delay exponentially
3. ✅ 5th failed attempt triggers lockout
4. ✅ Lockout lasts 15 minutes
5. ✅ Successful unlock resets counter
6. ✅ State persists across page reload
7. ✅ Expired entries are cleaned up

### Git Branch Strategy

**Branch Decision**: Using `allatonce` branch for all epic implementation work.

```bash
git checkout allatonce
```

### Previous Story Intelligence

**From Story 1-6 (TOTP Registration UI)**:
- TOTP verification in useAuthStore.unlock()
- verifyAndRegister() for initial setup

**From Story 1-8 (Auth Guard & Session Routing)**:
- unlock() flow already implemented
- Error handling via useErrorStore

**From Story 1-10 (CI/CD)**:
- Security scans in CI will check for rate limiting

## Technical Requirements

### Mandatory Implementation Standards

1. **Use existing git branch**: You MUST work on the `allatonce` branch.

2. **Exponential backoff**: MUST use formula: baseDelay * 2^(attempt-1).

3. **Max attempts**: MUST lock after 5 failed attempts.

4. **Lockout duration**: MUST be 15 minutes.

5. **Persistence**: MUST persist rate limit state in localStorage.

6. **User feedback**: MUST show remaining wait time.

7. **TypeScript strict mode**: ALL code must compile without errors.

8. **Test coverage**: ALL rate limiting functions MUST have unit tests.

### Next Steps

After completing this story:
1. Commit all changes to `allatonce` branch
2. Update sprint-status.yaml and COMMIT
3. **Complete Epic 1 Retrospective** (optional story)
4. **Begin Epic 2: Profiles & Project Management**
